# Top Restaurant Menus – Informational Project

This repository hosts an educational HTML project focused on explaining how popular casual dining restaurant chains structure their menus, pricing models, and digital menu availability. The purpose of this project is purely informational and research-based.

The content explores general menu patterns such as appetizers, entrées, beverages, pricing strategies, seasonal items, and nutrition transparency commonly used across casual dining restaurants. It does not represent, claim ownership of, or affiliate with any restaurant brand.

Several well-known restaurant chains are referenced only as real-world examples to help users understand how menu structures work in the casual dining industry. All trademarks, brand names, and menu items belong to their respective owners.
